Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment Long-Period Event Catalog
in 80-Column Card-Format Text File

Explanation of Catalog Entries - rev. 1008

Columns       Data
-------       ---------------------------------------------------------

 3 - 4        Year

 6 - 8        Day of the year

10 - 13       Signal start time in hours and minutes

15 - 18       Signal stop time in hours and minutes; 9999 if the signal
              continues to the next event

20 - 35       Signal envelope amplitudes in mm measured on a standard
              compressed-scale plot.  Z component is used for stations
              11 and 12, and Y component is used for all the other
              stations.  Standard compressed plot is produced by first
              taking the absolute value of the difference between
              consecutive long-period data points, summing them over
              40 data points (approx. 6 s), and then plotting them at a
              scale of 157 digital units/cm in alternating polarities
              to give the appearance of a seismogram.  Four columns are
              assigned to each of Apollo stations 12 (or 11), 14, 15
              and 16.

37 - 40       Availability of seismograms in expanded time scale:
                1 = Calcomp incremental plotter plot
                2 = Versatec matrix plotter plot
              A single column is assigned to each of stations 12
              (or 11), 14, 15 and 16.

42 - 45       Data quality code (single column for each station):
                1 = no data available for the station
                2 = noisy data
                3 = signal is masked by another, larger event
                4 = compressed plot is clipped (original digital data
                    may not be clipped)
                5 = see comments
                6 = the time recorded with the data is computer-
                    generated, and thus is not exact

47 - 76       Comments

77            Event type:
                A = classified (matching) deep moonquake
                M = unclassified deep moonquake
                C = meteoroid impact
                H = shallow moonquake
                Z = mostly short-period event
                L = LM impact
                S = S-IVB impact
                X = special type

78 - 80       Matching deep moonquake class

82 - 85       New deep moonquake identification, July 2004
                A = deep moonquake with assigned number
                T = suspected long-period thermal moonquake with assigned number

--- Additional entries for levent.1008 ---

Deep moonquake events newly identified by Bulow et al. [JGR 110, E10003, doi:10.1029/2005JE02414, 2005; JGR 112, E09003, doi:10.1029/2006JE002847, 2007] have been added.

For these events, columns 15-18 (signal stop time) are left blank and columns 20-35 (signal envelope amplitudes) contain -1. only to indicate at which station the signal was detected.
